Overview

Tetris Optimizer is a Go program designed to compile successfully, assemble Tetris tetrominoes in order to create the smallest square possible, and identify each tetromino in the solution using uppercase Latin letters (A for the first one, B for the second, etc). The program expects at least one tetromino in the input text file. In case of bad format on the tetrominoes or a bad file format, it prints ERROR.

Error Handling: In case of bad format on the tetrominoes or a bad file format, the program prints ERROR.
Test Files: Unit testing is encouraged, and sample test files are provided.
